# AngularJS directive-like table with fixed header

Implementation responsive (RWD) and scrollable table with fixed header using HTML5, CSS grid and SASS compiler.

AngularJS was used to implement search functionality - input above the table with the following behavior

·         If the input is empty then show every row in the table (no filtering applied)

·         If user typed something into the input then show only rows in which at least one cell contains the input text. Hide the other rows.
